extends Node3D

''' Node3Ds have a local transform, which is relative to the parent node 
(as long as the parent node is also of or inherits from the type Node3D). 
This transform can be accessed as a 4Ã—3 Transform3D, 
or as 3 Vector3 members representing location, Euler rotation 
(X, Y and Z angles) and scale.'''
